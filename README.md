"# Latent_Vectors_to_Images" 
=============

Generative models use some latent noise and generate output. We train the generate based on its image reconstruction loss. But if we can the control the source latent noise we can generate interesting image patternts as output. For this demo the network takes some gaussian noise with fixed mean and standard dev and generates some abstarct output. We can then change the noise by varying mean and sd and produce some interesting results. Here are few images I generated prefesented in gif format.
